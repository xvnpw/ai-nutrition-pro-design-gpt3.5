| 4 | API Application | Attacker performs a denial of service (DoS) attack on the API Application | Denial of Service | This threat is applicable as the API Application may be targeted by attackers to disrupt its availability and prevent legitimate users from accessing the service. | Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to prevent excessive requests from overwhelming the API Application. Use load balancers and scalable infrastructure to distribute the load and handle high traffic. Implement monitoring and alerting systems to detect and mitigate DoS attacks in real-time. | Medium |


### Data flow 3: API Application -> API Database

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Application | Attacker gains unauthorized access to API Database | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker impersonating a legitimate user or application to gain unauthorized access to the API Database. | Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users and applications can access the API Database. Use secure protocols and encryption to protect data in transit. | High |
| 2 | API Application | API Database is vulnerable to SQL injection | Tampering | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker manipulating SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to or modify data in the API Database. | Implement input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Use database access controls and permissions to restrict unauthorized access to the API Database. | High |
| 3 | API Application | API Database is vulnerable to data leakage | Information Disclosure | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of sensitive data being exposed or leaked from the API Database. | Implement data encryption at rest and in transit to protect sensitive data stored in the API Database. Use access controls and permissions to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive data. | Medium |
| 4 | API Application | API Database is vulnerable to denial of service attacks | Denial of Service | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker launching a denial of service attack to disrupt the availability of the API Database. | Implement rate limiting, throttling, and other defensive measures to mitigate the impact of denial of service attacks. Regularly monitor and analyze traffic patterns to detect and mitigate potential attacks. | Medium |


### Data flow 4: Web Control Plane -> Control Plane Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Web Control Plane | Attacker gains unauthorized access to Control Plane Database | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as there is a potential for an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user or system and gain unauthorized access to the Control Plane Database. | Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized access. Use secure protocols, such as TLS, for communication between the Web Control Plane and the Control Plane Database. Regularly monitor and audit access to the Control Plane Database to detect any unauthorized activities. | High |
| 2 | Web Control Plane | Injection attack on Control Plane Database | Tampering | This threat is applicable as there is a potential for an attacker to inject malicious code or SQL queries into the input fields of the Web Control Plane, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the Control Plane Database. | Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent injection attacks. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. Regularly update and patch the Web Control Plane to address any known vulnerabilities. | High |
| 3 | Control Plane Database | Data leakage from Control Plane Database | Information Disclosure | This threat is applicable as there is a potential for sensitive data stored in the Control Plane Database to be leaked or exposed to unauthorized parties. | Implement strong access controls and permissions on the Control Plane Database to restrict access to sensitive data.
