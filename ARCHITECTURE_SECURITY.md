# (AI Generated) Architecture Threat Model

### Data flow 1: Client -> API Gateway

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Gateway | Attacker spoofs client identity and gains unauthorized access to API Gateway | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as API Gateway is the entry point for client requests and authentication is required to ensure the client's identity. | Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as API keys, OAuth, or JWT tokens to verify the client's identity. | High |
| 2 | API Gateway | Attacker performs input validation bypass and injects malicious code into API Gateway | Tampering | This threat is applicable as API Gateway processes client input and any bypass of input validation can lead to injection of malicious code. | Implement strict input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent injection attacks. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. | High |
| 3 | API Gateway | Attacker performs denial of service attack on API Gateway | Denial of Service | This threat is applicable as API Gateway is a critical component that handles client requests. A successful denial of service attack can disrupt the availability of the system. | Implement rate limiting, throttling, and request validation mechanisms to mitigate the impact of denial of service attacks. Use load balancers and distributed architectures to handle high traffic. | High |
| 4 | API Gateway | Attacker intercepts and decrypts sensitive data transmitted between client and API Gateway | Information Disclosure | This threat is applicable as sensitive data may be transmitted between the client and API Gateway. If intercepted and decrypted, it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information. | Implement secure communication protocols such as HTTPS/TLS to encrypt data in transit. Use secure encryption algorithms and regularly update SSL/TLS certificates. | High |
| 5 | API Gateway | Attacker gains unauthorized access to API Gateway administration interface | Elevation of Privilege | This threat is applicable as unauthorized access to the API Gateway administration interface can lead to unauthorized configuration changes and potential compromise of the system. | Implement strong access controls, multi-factor authentication, and regular security audits to prevent unauthorized access to the API Gateway administration interface. | High |


### Data flow 2: API Gateway -> API Application

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Gateway | Attacker bypasses authentication and gains unauthorized access to API Application | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as the API Gateway is responsible for authentication and authorization of clients before forwarding requests to the API Application. | Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication, token-based authentication, or certificate-based authentication. Use secure protocols like HTTPS to protect the communication between the API Gateway and API Application. | High |
| 2 | API Gateway | Attacker performs input validation bypass and injects malicious data into API Application | Tampering | This threat is applicable as the API Gateway is responsible for filtering and validating input data before forwarding it to the API Application. | Implement strict input validation mechanisms to prevent input validation bypass attacks. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. Implement input sanitization techniques to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. | Medium |
| 3 | API Application | Attacker exploits a vulnerability in the API Application and gains unauthorized access to sensitive data | Elevation of Privilege | This threat is applicable as the API Application may have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. | Regularly update and patch the API Application to fix known vulnerabilities. Implement secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure direct object references (IDOR). Perform regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. | High |
| 4 | API Application | Attacker performs a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the API Application | Denial of Service | This threat is applicable as the API Application may be targeted by attackers to disrupt its availability and prevent legitimate users from accessing the service. | Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to prevent excessive requests from overwhelming the API Application. Use load balancers and scalable infrastructure to distribute the load and handle high traffic. Implement anomaly detection and intrusion prevention systems to detect and mitigate DoS attacks. | Medium |


### Data flow 3: API Application -> API Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Application | Attacker gains unauthorized access to API Database | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker impersonating a legitimate user or application to gain unauthorized access to the API Database. | Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users and applications can access the API Database. Use secure protocols and encryption to protect data in transit. | High |
| 2 | API Application | API Database is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks | Tampering | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker manipulating SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to or modify data in the API Database. | Implement input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Use prepared statements or stored procedures to ensure that user input is properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. | High |
| 3 | API Database | API Database is vulnerable to data leakage | Information Disclosure | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of sensitive data being exposed or leaked from the API Database. | Implement access controls and encryption to protect sensitive data stored in the API Database. Regularly monitor and audit access to the database to detect and prevent unauthorized access or data leakage. | Medium |
| 4 | API Database | API Database is vulnerable to data corruption | Denial of Service | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker intentionally or unintentionally modifying or deleting data in the API Database, leading to data corruption or loss. | Implement backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure that data can be restored in case of data corruption or loss. Regularly test and validate backups to ensure their integrity. Implement access controls and auditing to detect and prevent unauthorized modifications or deletions of data. | Medium |


### Data flow 4: Web Control Plane -> Control Plane Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Web Control Plane | Unauthorized access to Control Plane Database | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of unauthorized access to the Control Plane Database. | Implement strong authentication and access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access the Control Plane Database. Regularly monitor and audit access logs to detect any unauthorized access attempts. | High |
| 2 | Web Control Plane | Data leakage from Control Plane Database | Tampering | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of data leakage from the Control Plane Database. | Implement encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data stored in the Control Plane Database. Regularly monitor and audit access logs to detect any unauthorized access or data leakage. | Medium |
| 3 | Control Plane Database | Database server compromise | Elevation of Privilege | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of the Control Plane Database server being compromised. | Implement strong security measures such as regular patching and updates, firewall rules, and intrusion detection systems to protect the Control Plane Database server from compromise.
