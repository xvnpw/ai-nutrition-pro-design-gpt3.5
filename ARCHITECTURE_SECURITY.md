Regularly update and patch the API Gateway to address any security vulnerabilities. | High |
| 2 | API Gateway | Attacker performs input validation bypass and injects malicious code into API Application | Tampering | This threat is applicable as the API Gateway is responsible for filtering and validating input before forwarding requests to the API Application. | Implement strict input validation and sanitization mechanisms in the API Gateway to prevent injection attacks. Regularly update and patch the API Gateway to address any security vulnerabilities. | High |
| 3 | API Application | Attacker exploits a vulnerability in the API Application and gains unauthorized access to sensitive data | Elevation of Privilege | This threat is applicable as the API Application processes and stores sensitive data. | Implement secure coding practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and proper error handling, to prevent common vulnerabilities. Regularly update and patch the API Application to address any security vulnerabilities. | High |
| 4 | API Application | Attacker performs a denial of service attack on the API Application | Denial of Service | This threat is applicable as the API Application is a critical component that needs to be available for legitimate users. | Implement rate limiting, throttling, and request validation mechanisms in the API Gateway to mitigate the impact of denial of service attacks. Regularly monitor and analyze traffic patterns to detect and mitigate potential attacks. | High |


### Data flow 3: API Application -> API Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Application | Attacker gains unauthorized access to API Database | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker impersonating a legitimate user or system to gain unauthorized access to the API Database. | Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users and systems can access the API Database. Use secure protocols and encryption to protect data in transit. | High |
| 2 | API Application | API Database is compromised | Tampering | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of the API Database being compromised by an attacker. | Implement strong security measures such as regular security audits, vulnerability scanning, and intrusion detection systems to detect and prevent unauthorized access to the API Database. Encrypt sensitive data stored in the database to protect it from unauthorized access. | High |
| 3 | API Application | Data leakage from API Database | Information Disclosure | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of sensitive data being leaked from the API Database. | Implement access controls and encryption to protect sensitive data stored in the API Database. Regularly monitor and audit access to the database to detect and prevent unauthorized access. | Medium |
| 4 | API Application | API Database is not properly backed up | Denial of Service | This threat is applicable as the API Database may experience data loss or become unavailable if it is not properly backed up. | Implement regular backup procedures for the API Database to ensure that data can be restored in the event of data loss or system failure. Test the backup and restore processes to ensure their effectiveness. | Medium |


### Data flow 4: Web Control Plane -> Control Plane Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Web Control Plane | Attacker gains unauthorized access to Control Plane Database | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as there is a potential for an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user or system and gain unauthorized access to the Control Plane Database. | Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized access. Use secure protocols, such as TLS, for communication between the Web Control Plane and the Control Plane Database. Regularly monitor and audit access to the Control Plane Database to detect any unauthorized activities. | High |
| 2 | Web Control Plane | Injection attack on Control Plane Database | Tampering | This threat is applicable as there is a potential for an attacker to inject malicious code or SQL queries into the input fields of the Web Control Plane, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the Control Plane Database. | Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent injection attacks. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. Regularly update and patch the Web Control Plane to address any known vulnerabilities. | High |
| 3 | Control Plane Database | Data leakage from Control Plane Database | Information Disclosure | This threat is applicable as there is a potential for sensitive data stored in the Control Plane Database to be leaked or exposed to unauthorized parties. | Implement strong access controls and permissions on the Control Plane Database to restrict access to sensitive data. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Regularly monitor and audit access to the Control Plane Database to detect any unauthorized activities. Implement data loss prevention mechanisms to prevent accidental or intentional data leakage. | Medium |
