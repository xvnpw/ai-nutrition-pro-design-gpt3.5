| 2 | API Gateway | Attacker performs input validation bypass and injects malicious data into API Gateway | Tampering | This threat is applicable as the API Gateway needs to validate and filter input data from the Meal Planner application. | Implement strict input validation and filtering mechanisms to prevent injection attacks. Use parameterized queries and input sanitization techniques. | Medium |
| 3 | API Gateway | Attacker performs denial of service attack on API Gateway | Denial of Service | This threat is applicable as the API Gateway needs to handle a large number of requests from the Meal Planner application. | Implement rate limiting, throttling, and request validation mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks.

Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. Implement input sanitization techniques to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. | Medium |
| 3 | API Application | Attacker exploits a vulnerability in the API Application and gains unauthorized access to sensitive data | Elevation of Privilege | This threat is applicable as the API Application may have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. | Regularly update and patch the API Application to fix known vulnerabilities. Implement secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure direct object references (IDOR). Perform regular security testing and code reviews to identify and fix any security vulnerabilities. | High |
| 4 | API Application | Attacker performs a denial of service (DoS) attack on the API Application | Denial of Service | This threat is applicable as the API Application may be targeted by attackers to disrupt its availability and prevent legitimate users from accessing the application. | Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to prevent excessive requests from overwhelming the API Application. Use load balancers and scalable infrastructure to distribute the load and handle high traffic. Implement monitoring and alerting systems to detect and mitigate DoS attacks in real-time. | Medium |


### Data flow 3: API Application -> API Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Application | Attacker gains unauthorized access to API Database | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker impersonating a legitimate user or application to gain unauthorized access to the API Database. | Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users and applications can access the API Database. Use secure protocols and encryption to protect data in transit. | High |
| 2 | API Application | API Database is compromised | Tampering | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of the API Database being compromised by an attacker. | Implement strong security measures such as regular security audits, vulnerability scanning, and intrusion detection systems to detect and prevent unauthorized access to the API Database. Encrypt sensitive data stored in the database to protect it from unauthorized access. | High |
| 3 | API Application | Data leakage from API Database | Information Disclosure | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of sensitive data being leaked from the API Database. | Implement strict access controls and encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data stored in the API Database. Regularly monitor and audit access to the database to detect and prevent unauthorized data leakage. | Medium |
| 4 | API Application | API Database is not properly backed up | Denial of Service | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of the API Database not being properly backed up, leading to potential data loss and service disruption. | Implement regular and automated backup procedures for the API Database to ensure that data is properly backed up and can be restored in case of data loss or system failure. Test the backup and restore processes regularly to ensure their effectiveness. | Medium |


### Data flow 4: Web Control Plane -> Control Plane Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Web Control Plane | Attacker gains unauthorized access to Control Plane Database | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as there is a potential for an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user or system and gain unauthorized access to the Control Plane Database. | Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized access. Use secure protocols, such as TLS, for communication between the Web Control Plane and the Control Plane Database. Regularly monitor and audit access to the Control Plane Database to detect any unauthorized activities. | High |
| 2 | Web Control Plane | Injection attack on Control Plane Database | Tampering | This threat is applicable as there is a potential for an attacker to inject malicious code or SQL queries into the input fields of the Web Control Plane, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the Control Plane Database. | Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent injection attacks. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. Regularly update and patch the Web Control Plane to address any known vulnerabilities. | High |
| 3 | Control Plane Database | Data leakage from Control Plane Database | Information Disclosure | This threat is applicable as there is a potential for sensitive data stored in the Control Plane Database to be leaked or exposed to unauthorized parties. | Implement strong access controls and permissions on the Control Plane Database to restrict access to sensitive data. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Regularly monitor and audit access to the Control Plane Database to detect any unauthorized activities. Implement data loss prevention mechanisms to prevent accidental or intentional data leakage. | Medium |
