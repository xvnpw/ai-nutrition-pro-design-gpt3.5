### Data flow 1: Meal Planner application -> API Gateway

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


### Data flow 2: API Gateway -> API Application

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Gateway | Attacker spoofs API Gateway | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as the API Gateway can be spoofed by an attacker. | Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as mutual TLS, to ensure the authenticity of the API Gateway. | High |
| 2 | API Gateway | Attacker performs API injection | Tampering | This threat is applicable as the API Gateway can be targeted for injection attacks. | Implement input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent API injection attacks. | Medium |
| 3 | API Application | Attacker exploits insecure API endpoints | Elevation of Privilege | This threat is applicable as the API Application may have insecure API endpoints. | Implement secure coding practices and perform regular security assessments to identify and fix any insecure API endpoints. | High |
| 4 | API Application | Attacker performs parameter manipulation | Tampering | This threat is applicable as the API Application can be targeted for parameter manipulation attacks. | Implement input validation and parameter integrity checks to prevent parameter manipulation attacks. | Medium |


### Data flow 3: API Application -> API Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Application | Attacker gains unauthorized access to API Database | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker impersonating a legitimate user or service to gain unauthorized access to the API Database. | Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users and services can access the API Database. Use secure protocols and encryption to protect data in transit. | High |
| 2 | API Application | Attacker executes SQL injection attack on API Database | Tampering | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker manipulating SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to or modify data in the API Database. | Implement input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Use prepared statements or stored procedures to ensure that user input is properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. | High |
| 3 | API Database | Attacker exfiltrates sensitive data from API Database | Information Disclosure | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the API Database and exfiltrating it. | Implement strong access controls and encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data stored in the API Database. Regularly monitor and audit access to the database to detect and respond to any unauthorized access attempts. | High |


### Data flow 4: Web Control Plane -> Control Plane Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Web Control Plane | Attacker gains unauthorized access to Control Plane Database | Spoofing | This threat is applicable because an attacker may attempt to impersonate a legitimate user or system to gain unauthorized access to the Control Plane Database. | Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized access. Use secure protocols, such as TLS, to encrypt communication between the Web Control Plane and the Control Plane Database. Regularly monitor and audit access to the Control Plane Database to detect any unauthorized activities. | High |
| 2 | Web Control Plane | Data leakage from Control Plane Database | Information Disclosure | This threat is applicable because sensitive data, such as configuration information and billing data, is stored in the Control Plane Database. | Implement access controls and encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data in the Control Plane Database. Regularly monitor and audit access to the Control Plane Database to detect any unauthorized access or data leakage. Implement data loss prevention measures, such as data encryption and data masking, to prevent data leakage. | Medium |
| 3 | Web Control Plane | Denial of Service (DoS) attack on Control Plane Database | Denial of Service | This threat is applicable because an attacker may attempt to overload the Control Plane Database with a high volume of requests, causing it to become unresponsive and unavailable. | Implement rate limiting and request throttling mechanisms to prevent excessive requests to the Control Plane Database. Implement load balancing and scalability measures to distribute the workload and handle high volumes of requests. Regularly monitor and analyze the performance of the Control Plane Database to detect any signs of DoS attacks. | Medium |
