### Data flow 1: Meal Planner application -> API Gateway

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


### Data flow 2: API Gateway -> API Application

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


### Data flow 3: API Application -> API Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Application | Attacker gains unauthorized access to API Database | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker impersonating a legitimate user or application to gain unauthorized access to the API Database. | Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users and applications can access the API Database. Use secure protocols and encryption to protect data in transit. | High |
| 2 | API Application | API Application sends sensitive data to API Database without encryption | Tampering | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker intercepting the data sent from the API Application to the API Database and tampering with it. | Implement encryption mechanisms, such as SSL/TLS, to ensure that sensitive data is encrypted before being sent to the API Database. Use secure protocols and encryption to protect data in transit. | Medium |
| 3 | API Database | Attacker gains unauthorized access to API Database | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker impersonating a legitimate user or application to gain unauthorized access to the API Database. | Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users and applications can access the API Database. Use secure protocols and encryption to protect data in transit. | High |
| 4 | API Database | API Database is not properly secured against SQL injection attacks | Tampering | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in the API Database to tamper with or extract sensitive data. | Implement proper input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Regularly update and patch the API Database to address any known vulnerabilities. | High |


### Data flow 4: Web Control Plane -> Control Plane Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Web Control Plane | Attacker gains unauthorized access to Control Plane Database | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as there is a potential for an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user or system and gain unauthorized access to the Control Plane Database. | Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication and secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS) to prevent unauthorized access. Regularly monitor and audit access logs to detect any suspicious activities. | High |
| 2 | Web Control Plane | Data leakage from Control Plane Database | Information Disclosure | This threat is applicable as there is a potential for sensitive data stored in the Control Plane Database to be leaked or exposed to unauthorized parties. | Implement strict access controls and encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data. Regularly monitor and audit access logs to detect any unauthorized access or data leakage. | Medium |
| 3 | Web Control Plane | Denial of Service (DoS) attack on Control Plane Database | Denial of Service | This threat is applicable as there is a potential for an attacker to launch a DoS attack on the Control Plane Database, causing service disruption or unavailability. | Implement measures such as rate limiting, traffic monitoring, and load balancing to mitigate the risk of DoS attacks. Regularly monitor and analyze system performance to detect and mitigate any potential DoS attacks. | High |
