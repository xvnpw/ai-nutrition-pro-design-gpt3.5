| 2 | API Gateway | Attacker performs API request tampering and modifies data sent to API Application | Tampering | This threat is applicable as the API Gateway is responsible for filtering and forwarding data to the API Application. | Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms in the API Gateway to detect and prevent API request tampering. Use secure communication protocols such as HTTPS to protect data in transit. | Medium |
| 3 | API Application | Attacker exploits a vulnerability in the API Application and gains unauthorized access to sensitive data | Elevation of Privilege | This threat is applicable as the API Application processes and stores sensitive data. | Regularly update and patch the API Application to address any known vulnerabilities. Implement access controls and authentication mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive data. | High |


### Data flow 2: API Application -> API Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Application | Attacker gains unauthorized access to API Database | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker impersonating a legitimate user or application to gain unauthorized access to the API Database. | Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users and applications can access the API Database. Use secure protocols (e.g., TLS) for communication between the API Application and the API Database. Regularly monitor and audit access to the API Database to detect any unauthorized access attempts. | High |
| 2 | API Application | Attacker manipulates data in API Database | Tampering | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker modifying or tampering with the data stored in the API Database. | Implement data validation and integrity checks to ensure the integrity of the data stored in the API Database. Use secure protocols (e.g., TLS) for communication between the API Application and the API Database. Implement access controls and permissions to restrict unauthorized modification of data in the API Database. Regularly monitor and audit changes to the data in the API Database to detect any unauthorized modifications. | High |
| 3 | API Database | Data leakage from API Database | Information Disclosure | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of sensitive data being leaked from the API Database. | Implement strong access controls and permissions to restrict access to sensitive data stored in the API Database. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Regularly monitor and audit access to the API Database to detect any unauthorized access attempts. Implement data loss prevention mechanisms to prevent accidental or intentional data leakage. | High |


### Data flow 3: Web Control Plane -> Control Plane Database

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Web Control Plane | Attacker gains unauthorized access to Control Plane Database | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as there is a potential for an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user or system and gain unauthorized access to the Control Plane Database. | Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication and secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS) to prevent unauthorized access. Regularly monitor and audit access logs to detect any suspicious activities. | High |
| 2 | Web Control Plane | Data leakage from Control Plane Database | Information Disclosure | This threat is applicable as there is a risk of sensitive data being leaked from the Control Plane Database. | Implement strict access controls and encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data stored in the Control Plane Database. Regularly monitor and audit access logs to detect any unauthorized access or data leakage. | Medium |
| 3 | Web Control Plane | Denial of Service (DoS) attack on Control Plane Database | Denial of Service | This threat is applicable as there is a risk of an attacker launching a DoS attack on the Control Plane Database to disrupt the availability of the system. | Implement measures such as rate limiting, traffic monitoring, and load balancing to mitigate the risk of DoS attacks. Regularly monitor the system for any abnormal traffic patterns or signs of DoS attacks. | High |


### Data flow 4: API Application -> ChatGPT-3.5

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Application | Attacker intercepts and modifies requests and responses between API Application and ChatGPT-3.5 | Tampering | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of an attacker intercepting and modifying the requests and responses between API Application and ChatGPT-3.5. | To mitigate this threat, the communication between API Application and ChatGPT-3.5 should be secured using encryption and message integrity mechanisms such as HTTPS/TLS. Additionally, input validation and output sanitization should be implemented to prevent injection attacks. | High |
| 2 | API Application | ChatGPT-3.5 impersonates API Application and sends malicious responses | Spoofing | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of ChatGPT-3.5 impersonating API Application and sending malicious responses. | To mitigate this threat, mutual authentication should be implemented between API Application and ChatGPT-3.5. This can be achieved by using secure tokens or certificates to verify the identity of both parties. | Medium |
| 3 | API Application | ChatGPT-3.5 exhausts API Application resources by sending a large number of requests | Denial of Service | This threat is applicable as there is a possibility of ChatGPT-3.5 exhausting API Application resources by sending a large number of requests. | To mitigate this threat, rate limiting and request throttling mechanisms should be implemented in API Application to prevent excessive requests from ChatGPT-3.5. Additionally, monitoring and alerting systems should be in place to detect and mitigate any potential denial of service attacks. | Medium |
