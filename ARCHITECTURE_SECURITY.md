# (AI Generated) Architecture Threat Model

### Data flow 1: Client -> API Gateway
| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Client | Attacker intercepts and modifies requests/responses | Tampering | Use HTTPS for secure communication. Implement message integrity checks. | High |
| 2 | API Gateway | Attacker bypasses authentication and gains unauthorized access | Spoofing | Implement strong authentication mechanisms. Use secure protocols. | High |
| 3 | API Gateway | Attacker overwhelms API Gateway with excessive requests | Denial of Service | Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms. Use load balancers for scalability. | Medium |
| 4 | API Gateway | Attacker injects malicious code in requests | Injection | Implement input validation and sanitization techniques. Use secure coding practices. | High |
| 5 | API Gateway | Attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive data | Elevation of Privilege | Implement access control mechanisms. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. | High |

### Data flow 2: API Gateway -> API Application
| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Gateway | Attacker is able to bypass authentication and access API Application | Spoofing | Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as API keys or OAuth | High |
| 2 | API Gateway | Attacker is able to perform Denial of Service (DoS) attack on API Gateway | Denial of Service | Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to limit the number of requests per second | Medium |
| 3 | API Application | Attacker is able to execute arbitrary code on the API Application | Elevation of Privilege | Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent code injection attacks | High |
| 4 | API Application | Attacker is able to access sensitive data stored in the API Database | Information Disclosure | Implement encryption and access controls to protect sensitive data | High |

### Data flow 3: API Application -> API Database
| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Application | Attacker gains unauthorized access to API database | Elevation of privilege | Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. Regularly update and patch the database. Encrypt sensitive data. | High |
| 2 | API Application | Attacker intercepts and modifies data in transit between API Application and API Database | Tampering | Implement secure communication protocols such as TLS/SSL. Use message integrity checks to detect tampering. | Medium |
| 3 | API Database | Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the database software | Elevation of privilege | Regularly update and patch the database software. Implement strong access controls and authentication mechanisms. | High |
| 4 | API Database | Attacker gains unauthorized access to the database | Elevation of privilege | Implement strong access controls and authentication mechanisms. Regularly update and patch the database. Encrypt sensitive data. | High |
