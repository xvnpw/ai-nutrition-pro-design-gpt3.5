# (AI Generated) Security Related Acceptance Criteria
**API Gateway**
- **AC1:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication and secure token-based authentication.
- **AC2:** Implement strict input validation and filtering mechanisms to prevent injection attacks. Use parameterized queries and input sanitization techniques.
- **AC3:** Implement rate limiting, throttling, and request validation mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks. Use load balancers and caching mechanisms to distribute the load.

**API Application**
- **AC4:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication, API keys, and OAuth. Regularly update and patch the API Gateway to address any security vulnerabilities.
- **AC5:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization mechanisms in the API Gateway to prevent injection attacks. Regularly update and patch the API Gateway to address any security vulnerabilities.
- **AC6:** Implement secure coding practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and proper error handling, to prevent common vulnerabilities. Regularly update and patch the API Application to address any security vulnerabilities.
- **AC7:** Implement rate limiting, throttling, and request validation mechanisms in the API Gateway to mitigate the impact of denial of service attacks. Regularly monitor and analyze traffic patterns to detect and mitigate potential attacks.

**API Database**
- **AC8:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users and systems can access the API Database. Use secure protocols and encryption to protect data in transit.
- **AC9:** Implement strong security measures such as regular security audits, vulnerability scanning, and intrusion detection systems to detect and prevent unauthorized access to the API Database. Encrypt sensitive data stored in the database to protect it from unauthorized access.
- **AC10:** Implement access controls and encryption to protect sensitive data stored in the API Database. Regularly monitor and audit access to the database to detect and prevent unauthorized access.
- **AC11:** Implement regular backup procedures for the API Database to ensure that data can be restored in the event of data loss or system failure. Test the backup and restore processes to ensure their effectiveness.
