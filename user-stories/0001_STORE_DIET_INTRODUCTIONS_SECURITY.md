# (AI Generated) Security Related Acceptance Criteria
Based on the provided user story, architecture description, and architecture threat model, the following are the security-related acceptance criteria for the specified architecture containers, services, or applications:

**API Gateway:**
- **AC1:** The API Gateway must enforce HTTPS for secure communication to prevent interception and tampering.
- **AC2:** The API Gateway must implement strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and spoofing attacks.
- **AC3:** The API Gateway must implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to mitigate the impact of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- **AC4:** The API Gateway must implement input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent injection attacks.

**API Application:**
- **AC5:** The API Application must enforce HTTPS for secure communication with the API Gateway and other components to prevent interception and tampering.
- **AC6:** The API Application must implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as API keys or OAuth, to prevent unauthorized access and spoofing attacks.
- **AC7:** The API Application must implement input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent code injection attacks.
- **AC8:** The API Application must implement access controls and encryption to protect sensitive data stored in the API Database.

**API Database:**
- **AC9:** The API Database must enforce strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and elevation of privilege.
- **AC10:** The API Database must implement encryption and secure communication protocols, such as TLS/SSL, to protect data in transit between the API Application and the API Database.
- **AC11:** The API Database must be regularly updated and patched to protect against known vulnerabilities.
- **AC12:** The API Database must implement strong access controls and authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and elevation of privilege.
- **AC13:** The API Database must have regular backups and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate the risk of data loss or corruption.

**Web Control Plane:**
- **AC14:** The Web Control Plane must enforce HTTPS for secure communication with the Control Plane Database to prevent interception and tampering.
- **AC15:** The Web Control Plane must implement strong authentication and access controls to prevent unauthorized access and elevation of privilege.
- **AC16:** The Web Control Plane must implement input validation and parameterized queries to prevent code injection attacks.
- **AC17:** The Web Control Plane must implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to mitigate the impact of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- **AC18:** The Web Control Plane must encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest to protect against information disclosure.

Please note that these acceptance criteria are specific to the mentioned architecture containers, services, or applications and do not include acceptance criteria for other components or data flows not included in the user story.
