# (AI Generated) Security Related Acceptance Criteria
**API Gateway**
- **AC1:** The API Gateway must enforce strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication, API keys, and OAuth.
- **AC2:** The API Gateway must implement strict input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent code injection attacks.
- **AC3:** The API Gateway must implement rate limiting, throttling, and other measures to mitigate denial of service attacks.

**API Application**
- **AC4:** The API Application must implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication, token-based authentication, or certificate-based authentication.
- **AC5:** The API Application must implement strict input validation mechanisms to prevent input validation bypass attacks.
- **AC6:** The API Application must regularly update and patch to fix known vulnerabilities and implement secure coding practices.
- **AC7:** The API Application must implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to prevent denial of service attacks.

**API database**
- **AC8:** The API database must implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users and applications can access it.
- **AC9:** The API database must implement input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **AC10:** The API database must implement data encryption at rest and in transit to protect sensitive data.
- **AC11:** The API database must implement rate limiting, throttling, and other defensive measures to mitigate the impact of denial of service attacks.
