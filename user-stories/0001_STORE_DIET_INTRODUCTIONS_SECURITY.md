# (AI Generated) Security Related Acceptance Criteria
Based on the provided user story, architecture description, and architecture threat model, the following are the security-related acceptance criteria for the specified architecture containers, services, or applications:

**API Gateway:**
- **AC1:** The API Gateway must enforce authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
- **AC2:** The API Gateway must implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to mitigate the impact of excessive requests.
- **AC3:** The API Gateway must perform input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
- **AC4:** The API Gateway must use HTTPS for secure communication to prevent interception and tampering.

**API Application:**
- **AC5:** The API Application must implement strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
- **AC6:** The API Application must validate and sanitize input to prevent injection attacks.
- **AC7:** The API Application must regularly update and patch to address any known vulnerabilities.
- **AC8:** The API Application must encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest to protect confidentiality.
- **AC9:** The API Application must implement access control mechanisms to ensure proper authorization.

**API Database:**
- **AC10:** The API Database must enforce strong authentication and access controls to prevent unauthorized access.
- **AC11:** The API Database must encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest to protect confidentiality.
- **AC12:** The API Database must implement input validation and parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks.
- **AC13:** The API Database must regularly update and patch to address any known vulnerabilities.
- **AC14:** The API Database must have regular backups and disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity and availability.

Please note that these acceptance criteria are specific to the mentioned architecture containers, services, or applications and do not include acceptance criteria for other components or data flows not included in the user story.
